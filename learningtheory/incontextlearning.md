# In Context Learning

In-Context Learning (ICL) is the ability of large language models (LLMs) to learn new tasks at inference time by conditioning on examples provided in the input prompt, without updating any model weights. It allows LLMs to generalize to unseen tasks and domains purely through pattern recognition and attention over tokens.
