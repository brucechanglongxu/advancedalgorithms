What should we do when we are faced with a limited about of labeled data for supervised learning tasks? We will try to involve some expert labelers when possible, but within a certain budget in order to be smart regarding which samples to label. Given an unlabeled dataset $$\mathcal{U}$$ and a fixed amount of labeling cost $$B$$, active learning techniques aim to select a subset of $$B$$ examples from $$\mathcal{U}$$ to be labeled to result in maximized improved model performance; this is particularly important in the medical field, where labeled data is costly to come by.
