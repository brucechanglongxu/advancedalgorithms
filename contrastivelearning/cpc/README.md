# Contrastive Predictive Coding (CPC)

Contrastive Predictive Coding (CPC) is a self-supervised learning method introduced by Aaron van den Oord, Yazhe Li, and Oriol Vinyals in 2018 (DeepMind). It learns powerful latent representations by predicting the future in latent space using a contrastive loss, without relying on explicit labels.
