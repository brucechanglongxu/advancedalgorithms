# Contrative Learning

Much recent progress in AI has come from techniques that do not require labeled data but instead create self-supervised learning objectives. Two major families are contrastive learning and masked prediction strategies. These approaches enable learning rich representations from unlabeled data, which can then be fine-tuned for downstream tasks â€“ crucial for leveraging the vast amounts of raw data available.
