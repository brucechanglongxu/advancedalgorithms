# Quantization

Quantization refers to converting higher-precision data types into lower-precision formats. _Lower-precision types mean fewer bytes per element_. Reducing bytes per element will increase **arithmetic intensity[^1]**.

[^1]: Recall that arithmetic intensity is defined as FLOPs/bytes.
