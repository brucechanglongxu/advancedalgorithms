# Representation Learning

_Representation Learning_ refers to techniques that allow a model to automatically discover the representations (features) needed for downstream tasks, rather than using hand-crafted features. The core idea is to learn _embeddings_: vector representations of data (images, text, users etc.) that capture the important information in low-dimensional space.
